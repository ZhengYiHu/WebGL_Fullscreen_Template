# WebGL_Fullscreen_Template
 A full screen template for Unity WebGL builds

 ## Overview

 The default UnityWebGL template is not the cleanest when it comes to appearance.
 This templates removes a lot of the noises and makes that the built game will stretch across the whole page like full screen game!

  ## Usage

  Download the `FullScreen` folder and place it under `Assets/WebGLTemplates` (Create the folder if it doesn't exist).

  Under `Edit -> Project Setting -> Player -> Resolution and Presentation`, you can find the newly imported templated to be selected.
